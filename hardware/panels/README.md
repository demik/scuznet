Notes
-----
If using JLC to build panels, set "Mark ON PCB" option to "Order Number (Specify Position)"

You will need to do some machining so the panels screws heads can be flush.
You can create a countersink by using by using a big metal drill bit with a cordless drill.
Two turns should be enough, then blackout the visible material with paint or a sharpie
